I am currently a **PhD student** at **Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**, where I am fortunate to be working under the supervision of [**Prof. Lihua Xie**][xie].

I received both my **Bachelor’s** and **Master’s degrees** in **Control and Automation Engineering** from **Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)**, graduating as valedictorian.

I am a control guy! My research interests lie in **control theory**, **networked control systems**, **resilient control**, and **learning-based control**. I have been actively involved in research and teaching, and have published in peer-reviewed journals in these areas.
